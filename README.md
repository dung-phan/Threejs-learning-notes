# Introduction
Some personal notes before this documentation gets more technical: This repo is used to keep track of my (enduring and challenging) learning journey with Threejs. I have started, stopped and picked it up again for so many times and for so many reasons (yes yes, like so many other things in life...). Learning from my past behaviours, I decided to create a notebook where I can store what I've learnt every day. Hopefully one day looking back, I can be proud of my humble efforts and what I can build with it.
