# Introduction
This repo is used to keep track on my (enduring and challenging) learning journey with Threejs. I have started, stopped and picked it up again for so many times and for so many reasons (yes yes, like so many other things in life...). Learning from my past behaviours, I decided to create a notebook where I can store what I've learnt every day. Hopefully one day looking back, I can be proud of my humble efforts and what I can build with it.

# Content

The repo is constantly updated as I follow the course [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) of Bruno Simon which I can't recommend enough. I have been having lots of fun just to experiment and try out things. 
<br>
Each folder have their own README file where I note some key points down, and also use it as a reference place to find/copy&paste what I need. 

**Lesson 1. [Basic scene](./basic-scene)**

An introduction into Threejs: what are the main elements to create a scene.

**Lesson 2. [Transform objects](./transforming-objects)**

Things start to get more fun here. What does it take to transform objects in space? You get to know about moving objects in accordance with different axes. 

**Lession 3. [Animations](./animations)**

What if you want to move your objects not just one time but in indefinite loops? That's when we need animations.

**Lession 4. [Cameras](./cameras)**

At some point you also want to be able to control your camera: how to position and move it during the animation. 

**Lession 5. [Fullscreen and Resizing](./fullscreen-and-resizing)**

Ahhh, responsiveness... The elephant in the room. As a developer, you will want your objects to be able to maintain its <b>pixel ratio</b> when you resize your screen or to make it your renderer compatiable with your computer capacity.
